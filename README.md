# NTRIP_LAN_Client_for_Arduino
An NTRIP Client suitable for use with an Arduino Uno and an Ethernet shield

This script and the associated files allow and Arduino Uno and an Ethernet shield to act as an NTRIP Server.

The intended hardware is an Arduino Uno, and Ethernet Shield V2, and a SimpleRTK2B stacked on top of each other.
Note that some insulation (be that some tape or an arduino shield plastic base) is required to stop the ethernet and GPS shields shorting between solder joints.
